Code to adjust awards won into qualitative variables:
```{r, comment=NA}
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

# --- Step 1: Function to count award wins ---
count_award_wins <- function(award_string) {
  if (is.na(award_string) || award_string == "") return(0L)
  
  # 1) Hyphen-based awards (e.g., MVP-1)
  placements_hyphen <- str_extract_all(award_string, "(?<=-)\\d+")[[1]]
  hyphen_wins <- sum(as.integer(placements_hyphen) == 1, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # 2) All-NBA teams (NBA1, NBA2, NBA3) — all count as wins
  nba_awards <- str_extract_all(award_string, "NBA[1-3]")[[1]]
  nba_wins <- length(nba_awards)
  
  hyphen_wins + nba_wins
}

# --- Step 2: Run everything inside ONE mutate() ---
nba <- nba %>%
  mutate(
    n_awards_won = vapply(Awards, count_award_wins, integer(1)),
    
    awards_factor = case_when(
      n_awards_won == 0 ~ "0 awards won",
      n_awards_won == 1 ~ "1 award won",
      n_awards_won >  1 ~ "more than 1 award won"
    ),
    awards_factor = factor(
      awards_factor,
      levels = c("0 awards won", "1 award won", "more than 1 award won")
    ),
    
    # Only two dummy variables (k - 1)
    awards_1     = ifelse(awards_factor == "1 award won", 1, 0),
    awards_2plus = ifelse(awards_factor == "more than 1 award won", 1, 0)
  )

nba

```

Adding "Stocks (steals + blocks)" column
```{r}
nba <- nba %>%
  mutate(stocks = STL + BLK) %>%
  relocate(stocks, .after = BLK)
nba
```


Converting updated table to downloadable Excel
```{r, comment=NA}
install.packages("openxlsx")
library(openxlsx)

write.xlsx(nba, "updated_nba_merged.xlsx")

```
```{r}
```


```{r}
```
